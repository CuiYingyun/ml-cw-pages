## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ml-cw-pages
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Locally

To start the local development server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will:
- Start a local server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
- Enable live reload for development
- Watch for file changes and automatically rebuild

### Development Workflow

1. **Edit Content**: Modify markdown files in the `docs/` directory
2. **Preview Changes**: The site automatically reloads when you save files
3. **Build for Production**: Use `mkdocs build` to generate static files
4. **Deploy**: Push changes to trigger automatic deployment
